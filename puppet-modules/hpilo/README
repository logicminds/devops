This module will configure your hp ilo card automatically without 
the use of a password that is phsycially printed on the server.

This module is very useful for when you don't have physical access
to the server and can't get the ilo admin password or you have many
servers to configure and the web interface just takes to long. 
Fear not, there is now a puppet module to help you out.

This is the hpilo module. Please see manifests/base.pp for more info.
You will need to make changes to the base.pp file to suit your environment.

If you have suggestions on how to improve this module please send me an email.


Usage:
1. Configure the manifests/base.pp file to suit your environment
2. Assign hpilo::dhcp or hpilo::static class to your system(s).

hpilo::dhcp = uses your dhcp to assign the IP to the ilo
hpilo::static = assigns a static ip to the ilo
hpilo::base = the base class for hpilo::dhcp and hpilo::static

Requirements:
1. You must have the proliant support pack installed, specifically the hponcfg utility in /sbin

How it works:
1. A ilo configuration file is automatically created via the iloconfig.erb template
   and your variables in manifests/base.pp
2. The ilo config file is placed in /ilosettings.xml on the node
3. if /sbin/hponcfg exists, puppet will then configure the ilo interface with this ilosettings.xml file
4. Your ilo card will reset after the settings have been applied with the new values defined in ilosettings.xml
